<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_obtain_a_quick_view_of_my_apps_performance"></a><h3>How do obtain a quick view of my app's performance?</h3>
<p>The <em>Apps &gt; Monitor  &gt; Overview</em> section includes a barometer style Dashboard controls that  allows you to view  throughput, latency, and errors for messages in  real-time for Sandbox and Production environments of APIs your app is connected to. Statistics are calculated  for all APIs that you app is connected to, and for all operations included in the APIs. You  can obtain statistics on a per-second or per-minute basis. The Dashboard displays statistics for the last  24 hours.</p>
<p>
  The Dashboard  controls scale based on the number of messages received and the time interval selected  (sec or min). For example, 50 messages were transmitted for your API in the  last 5 seconds; the scale will change to 0-60.</p>
<p>
  The Dashboard  provides the following control types:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Throughput:</strong> Provides statistics on the rate of successful message delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Latency:</strong> Provides statistics on the amount of time it takes to process a message from source to destination.</li>
<li><strong>Errors:</strong> Provides statistics on the number of errors incurred during message delivery.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Usage data  is further categorized by <em>API Usage</em> and can be exported. See <a href="#how_do_i_export_api_usage_for_apis_that_my_app_is_connected_to">How do I export API usage data for APIs that my App is connected to?</a></p>

<a name="how_do_i_monitor_app_performance"></a><h3>How do I monitor app performance?</h3>
<p>Performance charts are included in the <em>My Apps &gt; Monitor</em>page. They provide a mechanism for all platform  members to view the performance of their apps and the APIs their apps are consuming. Chart data can be used to monitor API usage over a span of time or to troubleshoot errors with API operation.</p>
<p>The Performance Chart functionality allows you to view performance in sandbox or production modes, provides monitoring for tracking service response time and transaction faults. Charts are populated by usage &quot;roll-up&quot; data that is gathered during the processing of web service request and response messages. Historic usage and performance data can be queried and viewed in the Usage Logs section. See <a href="#how_do_i_monitor_app_usage_logs">How do I monitor app usage logs?</a></p>
<p>Performance Charts automatically scale the Y axis to show an appropriate range for the data shown. You can choose to scale to the average (i.e., default) based on the selected interval or set your own scaling.</p>
<p><em>Note: Updating of chart performance statistics using <strong>Refresh</strong> is based on your selected Duration and Interval which represents the total time range displayed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chart Types</strong></p>
<p>The following performance charts types are supported. All chart data is presented in milliseconds (ms).</p>
<table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 90%;">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">Chart Name</th>
    <th width="80%">Description</th>

    <tr class="t2row">
      <td>Min / Max / Avg Response Time</td>
      <td><p>Minimum, Maximum, and Average Response Times for transactions are depicted in a candlestick bar chart on the Y axis.</p>
      <p>You can also hover over each time interval and view a Datapoint Pop-up that displays the Date, Time, Average, Max, and Min Response time of the transaction for the selected time interval.</p></td>
    </tr>
  <tr class="t1row">
    <td>Success / Fault Throughput</td>
    <td><p>Successful transactions and faults are depicted in a single chart with two&nbsp;Y axes.</p>
      <p>Successful transactions are depicted in a column chart. A vertical bar displays the number of transactions that have successfully processed for the selected response time range.</p>
      <p>Faults are depicted in a scatter chart. A red dot represents the number of Faults associated with a specific time interval.</p></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Time Range</strong></p>
<p>The Performance Chart includes a navigation control (located at the bottom of the chart) that allows you to navigate the Timeline based on the selected Duration and Time Interval. Throughput data can also be monitored on the timeline and is presented in a spline chart.</p>
<p>After you have targeted a timeline, there are several ways to view additional chart detail. The <em>Zoom</em> feature allows you to view chart data by clicking on a pre-defined interval (1 hour, 3 hour, 6 hour, 12 hour, All). The Data Point Popup allows you to hover over a specific datapoint to view response data detail including Date, Time, Average, Max, and Min.</p>
<p><strong>Graph Controls</strong></p>
<p>The Graph Controls section of a Performance Chart
  provides options for configuring the chart content (i.e., a specific API, or all APIs), data capture and display intervals (i.e., Duration and Interval), and navigating and zooming the chart Timeline. Each chart displays data based on the  currently approved environment (i.e., Sandbox or Production).</p>
