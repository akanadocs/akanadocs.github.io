<h3>Custom Styles:</h3>


<a name="i_want_to_customize_platform_styles"></a><h3>I want to customize platform styles. What do I do?</h3>
<p>The platform comes with a default look and feel, including styles, colors, navigation, logo, and so on. These platform default styles are stored in a stylesheet which is dynamically generated from a file named <strong>custom.less</strong>.</p>
<p>If you want to customize platform styles, follow the basic steps below. If you want to start from the platform default styles and are modifying for the first time, follow the steps in <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>. If you have already modified your styles and want to make additional changes, use <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_additional_changes">To make additional changes to customized styles</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on what you can change, see <a href="#what_color_scheme_changes_are_supported_on_my_platform_deployment">What color scheme changes are supported on my platform deployment?</a></p>
<p class="apidoc_note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you upload new styles to the platform, you'll need to clear your browser cache and refresh the page to see the changes.</p>
<!--<p><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>custom.less</strong> is a subset of a larger site file, <strong>parameters.less</strong>, which includes additional variables you could customize; for example, the background color on tooltips is controlled by the <strong>tooltip-bg-color parameter</strong> in <strong>parameters.less</strong>, and this property is not present in <strong>custom.less</strong>. If you want to make customizations beyond the scope of <strong>custom.less</strong>, consult Technical Support for assistance in modifying the <strong>parameters.less</strong> file.</p>

<a name="what_color_scheme_changes_are_supported_on_my_platform_deployment"></a><h3>What color scheme changes are supported on my platform deployment?</h3>
<p>You can change the color scheme for platform elements such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Site background color</li>
  <li>Left and top navigation</li>
  <li>Text content area</li>
  <li>Pop-up dialog elements</li>
  <li>Horizontal rules</li>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_style_sheets_do_i_use_to_update_the_color_scheme_on_my_platform_deployment"></a><h3>What style sheets do I use to update the color scheme of my platform deployment?</h3>
<p>The platform includes a style sheet template, <strong>custom_template.less</strong>, that you can download, rename to <strong>custom.less</strong>, and update based on your requirements. For full instructions, refer to <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some general points regarding the platform style sheet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All of the variables and sprite file references in the custom_template.less file are configured with defaults that represent the look and feel of a default platform installation.</li>
  <li>All <strong>custom.less</strong> style sheet variables are commented out. For site elements you want to customize, remove the comment from the element and then customize the variable.</li>
  <li>Color management for icons is accomplished by modifying the Adobe Illustrator side production file that includes the sprite icon files.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_download_the_custom_template_less_template"></a>
<h3>How do I download the custom_template.less template?</h3>
<p>The <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em> section includes a <strong>Download Template</strong> button that allows you to download the custom_template.less template.</p>
<h5><a name="to_download_the_custom_template_less_template"></a>To download the custom_template.less template:</h5>

  <li>Select the <strong>Save File</strong> option and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_upload_my_customless_file_after_i_have_updated_it"></a><h3>How do I upload my custom.less file after I have updated it?</h3>
<p>The <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em> section includes an <strong>Upload</strong> button that allows you to upload the custom.less file after you've customized it.</p>
<h5>To upload the modified custom.less file:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em>.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Styles Customization</strong> section, click <strong>Upload</strong>. A <em>File to Upload</em> dialog box displays.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Browse</strong> to navigate to the location of your custom.less file and upload it. When you upload the file, the platform style sheets are automatically regenerated. When regeneration is complete a confirmation message is displayed.The custom.less file is stored in the \resources\less directory.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="After_i_update_my_customless_file_how_do_i_apply_the_changes_to_my_platform_deployment"></a><h3>After I update my custom.less file, how do I apply the changes to my platform deployment?</h3>
<p>After you update your <strong>custom.less</strong> file, you can apply the changes to the platform deployment by uploading the modified file. When you upload the file, the site automatically rebuilds the site style sheets and the changes are reflected on the site.
 See <a href="#how_do_i_upload_my_customless_file_after_i_have_updated_it">How do I upload my custom.less file after I have updated it?</a> for more information.</p>
<p> If the style sheet and sprite file changes are not visible immediately after the style sheet rebuild process is complete, clear the browser cache and then refresh.</p>
<p><em>Note: If you want to go back to the default styles at any point, you can always go back to the <strong>custom_template.less</strong> file. See <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>.</em></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_rebuild_my_color_scheme_styles_after_i_have_uploaded_the_customless_file"></a><h3>How do I rebuild my color scheme styles after I have uploaded the custom.less file?</h3>
<p>The <em>Administration > Config > Custom Styles</em> section includes a <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option that allows you to Initiate a rebuild of the platform style sheets. This option is primarily used when a platform update is installed that includes style sheet changes. This option is primarily used when a site update is performed where style sheet changes were made.</p>
<p>For example, if an update was applied to the site and the update included new additions to the UI that required style sheet changes; this would mean that the style sheets were not active immediately after the update was completed. In this case, the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option would complete update process by regenerating the style sheets.</p>
<h5>To rebuild site style sheets:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Custom Styles</em>.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Styles Customization</strong> section, click <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong>. The rebuild process takes approximately one minute. After style sheets have been rebuilt, the &quot;Platform style sheets have been successfully regenerated using custom.less&quot; confirmation message displays.</li>
  <li>After the style sheets are regenerated, clear the browser cache and refresh the screen to view the changes.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_a_sprite"></a><h3>What is a sprite?</h3>
<p>The platform UI includes a series of standard icons that accommodate quick filters, help, menu navigation names, window titles, etc. These standard icons cannot be changed, but when a UI customization is performed the color of the icon can be changed.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A sprite is a two-dimensional image that is used to change the color of the standard icons on the platform when a UI customization is performed.</li>
  <li>When developing your UI customization design, in addition to deciding what colors you want to use on your site, you must also decide what icons and "contrasts" are needed before moving forward with the customization tasks. This task should be part of your site UI design process.</li>
  <li>The platform provides a set of sprite files with the default theme. You can view how the sprite files are specified in the custom_template.less file. Each one is commented with " // path to the image file" and lists a URL that represents the path of the file.</li>
  <li><em>Note that sprite files should always be uploaded after you have uploaded and regenerated your style sheets. </em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/spriteimagefolder.jpg" width="600" height="303" alt="" /></p>
<p>Figure. Upload sprite files to \images folder via <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> (Resources &gt; File Manager)</p><br />
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_modify_sprite_colors"></a><h3>How do I modify sprite colors?</h3>
<p>During the UI design phase of your platform deployment your brand standards and colors are selected. The site includes a series of icons. The icon design is fixed and part of the site design, but the icon color and contrast can be changed. The general process for modifying icon colors involves the following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To change icon color and contrast, a series of sprite files that define the color contrast for platform icons must be updated by modifying the  Adobe Illustrator production file provided by SOA Software.</li>
  <li>The process involves selecting the Artboard that includes the icon you want to modify, changing the icon color, and saving the Artboard to a PNG file. The PNG file(s) must then be uploaded to the /resources/theme/default/styles/images folder via <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> to be updated in your platform UI.</li>
  <li>For detailed instructions on how to modify sprite files, click <a href="images/modify_sprite_colors.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
  <li>If you save a sprite file to filename that is not referenced in the custom_template.less file, edit the custom_template.less file and update the path to reflect the new filename. For example, if a particular icon was gray and you wanted it changed to orange, you might save your artwork to a new filename that reflected the color change or you could develop a naming convention using numbers, etc. The following example is an excerpt from a custom_template.less file that illustrates a sprite file URL reference:
<pre>// path to the image file of 18px sprites of leftnav navigation items that reflect the current section of &quot;subject&quot; details
// @leftnav-active-icons: @icon-active-18px: url(&quot;images/sprites_18_color.png&quot;);
</pre>
</li>
  <li>If you updated a style sheet, use the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option to regenerate the styles before uploading any new sprite files. Note that this function rebuilds all the folders in the /resources/theme/default/styles directory. Because of this, new sprite files must be uploaded after the site styles are regenerated.</li>
  <li>If you add a new Artboard to the Adobe illustrator production file, or save an existing Artboard as a different name, you must upload the updated sprite files to platform via the <em>Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> section and save them in the /resources/theme/default/style/images folder. This step should be performed after the <strong>Rebuild Styles</strong> option is used.</li>
  <li>After styles are regenerated and sprite files are uploaded, clear the browser cache and refresh the screen to view the changes.</li>
  <li>For information on uploading Sprite files to the platform, see <a href="#how_do_i_upload_sprite_files_to_the_platform">How do I upload Sprite files to the platform?</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="what_is_lessjs_and_what_are_the_benefits"></a><h3>What is less.js and what are the benefits?</h3>
<p>The custom.less style sheet is implemented with LESS which is a dynamic stylesheet language that extends the static CSS by adding a dynamic behavior in the CSS.</p>
<ul>
  <li>LESS.JS is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to write your own styles using the LESS pre-processor language and save them in a .LESS file.</li>
  <li>LESS.JS will compile the file into pure CSS. LESS variables are defined with an @ sign and Variable assignment is done with a colon (:). After you update the custom.less style sheet and rebuild, the values of the variables are inserted into the output CSS document.</li>
  <li>LESS helps reduce the size of the CSS and allows you to quickly and easily make changes to the platform color scheme and sprite files by updating one custom.less file and then rebuilding the complete set of site stylesheets.</li>
</ul>

<p>In most cases, after you regenerate styles and upload your sprite files you must clear the browser cache and refresh the screen to view the changes.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_custom_footer"></a><h3>How do I configure a custom footer?</h3>
<p>The footer customization process includes the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Footer customization is done with an HTML file that acts as a template. The HTML file is uploaded to the /resources/templates/footer with the name footer.htm.</li>
  <li>Links in the footer.htm file can have a class attribute with values "ext" or "dialog." When a link has a class "ext," clicking on the link will open a popup window. When the link has a class "dialog," clicking on the link will open the href in a dialog window.</li>
  <li>A footer can be uploaded using the File Manager in the <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources &gt; Resources </em>section. An uploaded footer becomes effective within five minutes if the page is refreshed after five minutes.</li>
  <li>If the footer.htm file requires additional styles, you can add them to custom.less.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_custom_logo"></a><h3>How do I configure a custom logo?</h3>
<p>The process of adding a custom logo to the platform includes configuring your logo to comply with the logo file requirements (listed below), specifying the logo filename in the template (see <a href="#to_customize_your_logo_filename">To specify your logo filename in the template</a> below) and uploading it to the platform (see <a href="#to_upload_your_logo_file">To upload your logo file</a> below).</p>


<h5>Logo File Requirements</h5>

<h4>Logins:</h4>



<a name="how_does_login_configuration_work"></a><h3>How does login configuration work?</h3>
<p>As part of the initial platform setup, a Site Administrator sets up a series of domains that represent an enterprise's login requirements for the platform. Supported domain types for the platform login include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Facebook</li>
  <li>OpenID Identity Provider (e.g., Google)</li>
  <li>LDAP</li>
  <li>CA SiteMinder</li>
</ul>
<p>In versions prior to 7.1.0, the platform installation also included a default platform domain that is automatically enabled when a new user account is created. In 7.1.0 and later, this default has been removed.</p>
<p>After the login domains are installed, they must be enabled and customized with the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Target Host (virtual host name)</li>
  <li>Logo/Avatar (Login Button)</li>
  <li>External login screen display mode (popup window or main window)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Logins</em> section includes a login management interface where the Site Admin can perform these tasks.</p>
<p>The screen is organized as follows:</p>
<table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 90%;">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">Domain Type</th>
    <th width="80%">Description</th>

<a name="does_the_platform_provide_a_default_login"></a><h3>Does the platform provide a default login?</h3>
<p>In versions prior to 7.1.0, the platform installation  supported certain security domains that allow login with email address and password to be automatically used once the security domain was created.</p>
<p>As of version 7.1.0, this default has been removed. The platform does not allow the default platform login screen to fall back to security domains supporting email/password-based login.</p>
<p>If your platform already had logins configured prior to upgrading to the version 7.1.0 release, the default option and configuration will be remain in place after upgrading. However, if you install 7.1.0 and then configure, you'll need to add the login domains and then enable them, in two separate steps.</p>
<p>For more information, including instructions for restoring the default by running a database query, see <a href="site_administration_domains.htm#how_do_i_enable_a_login_domain">How do I enable a login domain?</a></p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_is_a_target_host"></a><h3>What is a Target Host?</h3>
<p>Site Administrators can specify different URLs for logging into the platform based on role (Business Admin, API Admin, Developer, and so forth), or for a Backdoor Login if one of the domain configurations is down. This is accomplished by specifying a virtual host address for each login domain referred to as a <em>Target Host</em> (e.g., &lt;role&gt;.&lt;company&gt;.com).</p>
<p>The recommended approach is to develop a login plan for each role that covers different types of login scenarios.</p>
<p>For example, if your site uses CA SiteMinder exclusively for logins, and the CA SiteMinder login is down for some reason, you will need a backdoor login to investigate the problem. To provide a resolution for this scenario, here are two possible approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Configure the platform default login Target Host so that only the Site Administrator can log in using email and password credentials.</li>
  <li>Configure an alternate Facebook domain (using the Facebook Connector domain) or Google login domain (using the OpenID Relying Provider domain) and specify a Target Host for back door logins.
  </li>
</ul>

<a name="what_login_page_integration_modes_are_supported"></a><h3>What login page integration modes are supported?</h3>
<p>The platform allows you to select how the login page associated with a domain will be integrated. The integration method is selected via the <strong>Mode</strong> option on the <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Logins</em> page for a specific domain. Two options are supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Popup</em>&#8212;Displays the external login page as a popup.</li>
  <li><em>Main</em>&#8212;Displays the external login page in the platform home page instead of a popup.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: Mode options are not configurable for the default login page. </em></p>

<a name="how_do_i_configure_a_session_timeout_value"></a><h3>How do I configure a session timeout value?</h3>
<p>You can configure a session timeout value for the platform, so that if a user is inactive for a specified period of time the user is automatically logged out.</p>
<p>Currently, you cannot change this setting via the user interface, but you can do it by running a database query. Replace the values in angle brackets below (remove the angle brackets also):</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>&lt;no-of-minutes&gt;</strong>: replace with the session timeout value you want, in minutes. If the value is set to 0 (zero) there is no timeout; if it is set to 30, the session times out after 30 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>&lt;tenant-id&gt;</strong>: replace with your specific tenant ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>Update the values, and then run the following query on your database:</p>
<pre>update LOGIN_RULES set LOGIN_SESSION_TIMEOUT=<strong>&lt;no-of-minutes&gt;</strong> where TENANTID = (select TENANTID from TENANTS where FEDMEMBERID='<strong>&lt;tenant-id&gt;</strong>');</pre>

<h4>Resources:</h4>



<a name="what_is_a_resource"></a><h3>What is a Resource?</h3>
<p>In the context of the <em>Site Administration &gt; Config &gt; Resources</em> section, a Resource is any type of publishing artifact used in the construction of the platform UI presentation. This includes css style sheets, images, sprite files, site copy, API documentation, and online help documentation.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_upload_style_sheets_to_the_platform"></a><h3>How do I upload style sheets to the platform?</h3>
<p>When you upload a new custom.less file in the <em>Custom Styles</em> section, the /resources/theme/default/style directory is automatically created and includes the site default style sheets. Some points to note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>These style sheets cannot be updated using the upload process used for static content because the styles are regenerated each time a new <strong>custom.less</strong> style sheet is uploaded.</li>
  <li>If you want to add new styles to the platform, you must first download the template, custom_template.less, then rename it to custom.less, add the new styles to the custom.less file, and upload the modified file. When you upload the revised file in the Config section of the user interface, the new styles are added to the site as part of the rebuild process. For more information and detailed instructions, see <a href="#to_customize_platform_styles_for_the_first_time">To customize platform styles for the first time</a>.</li>
  <li>Only a Site Administrator can update the platform style sheet.<br />
