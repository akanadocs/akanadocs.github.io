<a name="what_are_the_components_of_the_site_administration_section"></a><h3>What are the components of the Site Administration section?</h3>
<p>The <em>Site Administration</em> quick filter launches the <em>Site Administration</em> section. Authorized site administrators can send out invitations to others whom they would like to invite to be site admins. All site admins have the same administration privileges for the platform deployment and can configure authentication domains that can be customized and assigned to APIs that are part of the platform deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Invite Administrators</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Invite More</strong> function allows you to send invitations to individuals that you would like grant administration privileges for your API.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Existing administrators  are displayed in a summary listing.</li>
  <li>When an invitation is sent a request email is issued.</li>
  <li>The invitee receives an invitation request on their <em>Dashboard</em> page. If the invitee is not a platform member, they must sign up using the same email address that the invitation is addressed to in order to accept the invitation via their <em>Dashboard</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>View Administrators</strong></p>
<p>When an administrator invitation is submitted, the username, email address, and invitation status (i.e., Email Sent, Approved, or Rejected) of the invitee is added to the <em>Site Admins Summary</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Manage Administrators</strong></p>
<p>A Site Administrator can remove another Site Administrator.</p>
