  <li>When an invitation is sent a &quot;Team Invite&quot; request email is issued.</li>
  <li>The invitee receives an invite on their <em>Dashboard</em> page. If the invitee is not a member, they must sign up using the same email address that the invitation is addressed to in order to accept the invitation via their <em>Dashboard</em>.</li>
  <li>See <a href="#how_do_i_create_a_development_team">How do I create a development team?</a></li>
